export const longQuery = "This is a very long text that is being added to the request body. It can contain various details, information, or descriptions relevant to the search query. For instance, we might discuss the importance of lorem ipsum in design and layout, how it's commonly used as placeholder text in graphic design, web development, and user interface design. The concept of using filler text dates back to the 1st century BC, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. Today, lorem ipsum is widely used across various fields and projects as a way to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. This long text serves to illustrate how additional data can be incorporated within the same structure, maintaining a coherent JSON format and ensuring that the information remains easily readable and relevant to the context of the search query. Moreover, using long text entries can help in testing the performance and capabilities of an API system, checking how it handles larger content sizes, and ensuring that proper handling and responses are given when such data is processed. Ultimately, the use of extensive placeholder text is a common practice that aids developers and designers in their workflows, providing them with a way to visualize their work without the distraction of actual content. The versatility and utility of lorem ipsum cannot be overstated, and it continues to be a staple in the design community."
